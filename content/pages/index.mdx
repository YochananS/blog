A little bit of Hope

A young boy was caught in a maze of darkness and he had just a little bit of hope he was going to figure it out and escape. 
There were two men who found this boy and started to follow him trying to grab his shirt and break his arms preventing him from escaping.
The boy however, had a special, priceless ingredient in his mind. It is called Hope.

His Hope enabled him to keep on going. He thought to him, “wow just a little bit of hope can get me through this problem!” He gave thanks up above and kept going. 
These two men were very frustrated that the boy had this ingredient. They did everything in there power to keep the boy from believing.
They were “sent” to distract and stir up the emotions of the boy causing him to loose hope and gain fear.

The boy had a close relationship with his father. His father and him were very close.
The boy listened to everything the father said. He obeyed all his advice.
The result of his love he had towards his father by listening and obeying all his father had said resulted in a divine protection called connection.

The connection gave the boy a supernatural understanding of the darkness of maze and the men who were out to get him.
When he listened to the father, he was safe. But when he tried to go a route that he thought it was right, it lead to a trap. 

Not many people understand this or realize this but life can be a darkness maze sometimes.
We are faced with so many different paths and we always think each way is the right way.
Sometimes a path has a little bit of light and we want to go that way.
I encourage you to know your opponent, know those two men and whom they work for, but more importantly know the father and his love towards you. 

“And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.” 
– 2 Corinthians 11:14

“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.”  
-John 10:10
